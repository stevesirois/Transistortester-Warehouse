* About

The Component Tester is based on the project of Markus Frejek [1&2] and the
successor of Karl-Heinz Kübbeler [3&4].


* Safety Advice

The Component Tester is no DMM! It's a simple tester for components capable
of measuring several things. The probes aren't protected in any way and
won't survive higher voltages than 5V. Don't use the tester for live circuits!
Just use it for unsoldered electronic components! If you test a capacitor make
sure it's discharged before connecting the probes. This isn't just the Safety
Sally, your life may be at risk if you connect the probes to a live circuit
or a power supply (or even mains). 


* What's in the box?

Following files are in the archive:
- this README
- schematics as PDF
- schematics and PCB layout in KiCad v5 format 


* Circuit

The circuit is meant as development kit for writing and testing firmware.
It comes with the basic tester (without display) and:
- weak input protection
- 2.5 V voltage reference
- rotary encoder
- boost converter for Zener check
- fixed self-adjustment cap
- fixed cap and relay for k-firmware's SamplingADC
- pin header for displays and hardware options


* Layout

The layout is optimized for home lab PCB production without through-hole
plating. I recommend to use precision sockets for the ICs. They allow to solder
the pins at the top layer without much trouble. You might need to grind the top
layer pads for the crystal to prevent any short circuit of the leads via the
metal case.
