  Modification for Multifunction Tester TC-1

  (c) 2018 by Markus Reschke (madires@theca-tabellaria.de)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TC-1 Transistor Tester clone uses an additional small MCU for controlling
the power supply causing an incompatibilty with the open source k and
m-firmware. This small circuit is meant to replace the control MCU U4 to
be able to run the open source firmware. I'd recommend to glue the tiny
PCB of the replacement circuit to the main PCB using hot glue, and to connect
U4's pads with thin enamel wire (magnet wire). Please see the included
pictures for an inspiration ;)

PS: Remove the Li-Ion battery during the modifaction to prevent any damage.
